[0.4 points] The overall quality of the report as a coherent, useful, and polished product will be reflected here. Does it make sense overall? Do your visualizations answer the questions you put forth in your business analysis? Do you properly and consistently cite sources and annotate changes made to base code? Do you provide specific reasons for your assumptions? Do subsequent questions follow naturally from initial exploration?

Interesting Question 4: Is there a correlation between unemployment rates and academic performance across different semesters? 

According to the heatmap, as shown previously, the answer is no. There is very little correlation between unemployment rates and first and second-semester grades. This could suggest that external economic factors, such as unemployment rates, may not have a significant impact on students' academic performance, at least in terms of grades. This could be a useful insight for educators and policymakers, as it could imply that academic performance is more closely tied to individual student factors rather than broader economic ones.
