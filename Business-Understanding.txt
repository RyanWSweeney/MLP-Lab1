It includes data for 4,424 students enrolled in various undergraduate programs. We have selected 17 out of 35 attributes that provide a comprehensive view of each student’s demographic background, socioeconomic status, and academic performance at different stages of their education.

The primary objective of this dataset is to understand the factors that influence student success in higher education institutions. 
This dataset combines data from multiple sources which include Academic Management System (AMS), the Support system for the Teaching Activity (PAE), 
the General Directorate of Higher Education (DGES), and macroeconomic data from PORDATA. 

This data was collected to support the development of a Learning Analytics tool designed to predict academic performance and dropout risks. 
The tool assists the tutors at the Polytechnic Institute of Portalegre by providing early warnings about students who may be at risk of 
underperforming or dropping out. By identifying these students early, the institution can implement targeted interventions to support them, 
such as personalized tutoring, counseling, or financial assistance.

The core prediction task involves a multi-classification model that can accurately categorize students into one of the following outcomes 
by the end of the semester: graduated, enrolled, or dropout. 

The information is valuable to many people. It’s useful to educational institutions because they can leverage these predictions to improve 
student retention rates, improve academic support services, and optimize resource allocation. The insights from the data will also benefit 
students and families helping them make informed decisions regarding course selection, financial planning, and seeking support services. We will need 
at least a 70% accuracy… lots of features….

What’s the point?
Student dropout and prolonged enrollment are significant challenges in higher education. High dropout rates can negatively impact an 
institution’s reputation, funding, and overall effectiveness. For students, dropping out often leads to personal and financial setbacks, 
including student loan debt without the benefit of a degree. By accurately predicting which students are at risk, institutions can improve 
retention rates, optimize resource allocation, and enhance student experience.

Developing a predictive model that accurately identifies at-risk students can provide immense value to educational institutions and stakeholders. 
By leveraging insights from the selected attributes, universities can implement targeted interventions to improve student retention and success rates. 
The ultimate goal is to support students in achieving their academic objectives while optimizing institutional resources and fostering a culture of 
success within the educational community.
