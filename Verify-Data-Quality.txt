The dataset exhibits excellent data quality, with no missing values reported across its 4424 records and 35 attributes, as stated in the report "Predicting Student Dropout and Academic Success" by Valentim Realinho et al. (Realinho et al., 2022). This indicates that thorough cleaning and preprocessing have been performed, ensuring data completeness. Consequently, there are no errors or quality concerns related to missing values. This high level of data quality is likely due to effective data collection and integration from multiple sources, including the Academic Management System, the Support System for Teaching Activity, the General Directorate of Higher Education, and the Contemporary Portugal Database. If missing values or duplicates were present, methods like elimination or imputation could have been used to resolve them. However, given the dataset's completeness, such actions are unnecessary.
