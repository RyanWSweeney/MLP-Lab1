The dataset exhibits excellent data quality, with no missing values reported across as stated in the report Predicting Student Dropout and Academic Success by Valentim Realinho et al. (Realinho et al., 2022). This indicates that thorough cleaning has been done and there are no errors or quality concerns related to missing values. This level of data quality is likely due to effective data collection from multiple sources, including the Academic Management System, the Support System for Teaching Activity, the General Directorate of Higher Education, and the Contemporary Portugal Database. All of the data falls within the expected ranges. For example, values for attendance, displacement, debtor status, tuition fees, gender, scholarship, and international status are correctly represented as either 0 or 1. Course numbers are within the range of 1 to 17, and grades (following the Portuguese grading system) are within the range of 0-10 (F) to 18-20 (A), ensuring consistency across the dataset. If missing values or duplicates were present, elimination or imputation could have been used. However, given the dataset's completeness, such actions are unnecessary.
